## Introduction

Hi, in this project I built a Memory Card game using React.
Game rules:

- The player is presented with a number of cards which have pictures and name.
- Every time the player click on a card they have never clicked before, they gain 1 score point.
- If they pick the card that have been chosen before, it is game over and the game restart.
- Try to get the max score!
